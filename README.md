Analysis of Stock Market Data

Instructions:https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/
Create a script to loop through all of the stocks for an entire year and output key information into a summary table, using the raw data provided.
Output the ticker symbol, the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the year to closing priceat the end of that same year, percent change from opening to closing for the year, and the total stock volume of each stock.
  In order to find the yearly change, a code will need to be run to determine the first opening and the last closing value for each       stock. Then include a mathematical code to determine the difference.
  Next, find the percent diffence based on the difference between those opening and closing values.
  Make sure to include the sum of each volume value for each stock in the total stock volume.

In order to create a VBA script for this data, "For loops" should be used along with conditionals (i.e. "if, then" statements)

Next, functionality will be added to the script in order to find the stocks with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume.

Also, ensure that the code will run through each worksheet within the Excel workbook using ws.
